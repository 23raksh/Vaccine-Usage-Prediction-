## Problem Statement:
Have to predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1 N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.

## Scope:
  Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  Data Pre-processing
  
  Training logistic model with MLE and SGD for prediction

## Learning Outcome:
Got a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insight and knowledge about the data we have and train Logistic Regression.
